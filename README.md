# Jenkins Build Status Light
> A project to bring the build status of a Jenkins build into the physical world

A bunch of us worked on this during an innovation day at the office to bring our Jenkins build pipeline into the physical realm with a RGB LED strip, and Arduino and some Python.

## Required items
1. 1x Arduino Uno (it should work on all similar boards)
2. 1x RGB LED strip
3. 3x TIP31C power transistors
4. 3x 1kÎ© resistors
5. 1x 12V power supply
6. Assorted cables and connectors
7. A breadboard for prototyping (we ended up building the circuit on some veroboard for the final solution)

## Installing / Getting started

Ensure you program your Arduino first and then run the Python script to start the build indicator.

### Arduino

You will need to install the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* This can be used to compile the .ino file and upload to your Arduino

### Python

You will need Python as well as PySerial (The scripts were developed using Python 2.7.x. and PySerial version 3.1.1). There is a great guide available [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-lesson-17-email-sending-movement-detector/installing-python-and-pyserial).

The two scripts are as follows
1. ```jenkinsBuildStatus.py``` - monitors the status of a normal Jenkins project
	* Simply changes the strip to be a solid colour if successful, failed or aborted and flashes on building
	* Usage: _jenkinsBuildStatus.py -j <jenkins_url> -b <baud_rate> -p <port> -f <poll_frequency_seconds> -a <b64(username:password)>_

```shell
python jenkinsBuildStatus.py -j https://jenkins.me/job/test -b 9600 -p COM11 -f 30 -a dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

2. ```jenkinsPipelineStatus.py``` - monitors the status of a [Jenkins pipeline ](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)
	* Usage: _jenkinsPipelineStatus.py -j <jenkins_url> -b <baud_rate> -p <port> -f <poll_frequency_seconds> -a <b64(username:password)>_

```shell
python jenkinsPipelineStatus.py -j https://jenkins.me/job/test -b 9600 -p COM11 -f 30 -a dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
